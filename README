Indexer as a standalone tool works perfectly

In recordio, rio_open, rio_close, and rio_lseek seem
to work properly
rio_read implemenation is complete and works fine

rio_write works well with adding content at the end of 
datafile.

testio tests rio_open, close, and lseek
fails when testing rio_read

I could not successfully use linking to link recordio.o to
testio
I can use the recordio library successfully if I include 
"recordio.c", but get linking errors when I replace
"recordio.c" with "recordio.h"
